# TODO

- TODO show active encoder/value

- TODO rename back componentValue to componentEncoder...

- TODO midi for encoder
    - might want to make midi, osc, and all kind of external interface a plugin
    - should midi on ui also forward midi to host?

- TODO components should be library to load

- TODO page of components list

- TODO centralized event handler
  value should callback to mainView and has params the index of the plugin +  a key if there is mutiple value in the component. Then mainView is in charge to spread the value change to all the component... Maybe this could  even be hadded directly on value host system -> hostValue function...

- TODO componentValue option rotate 90Â°

```cpp
float rotationAngle = 90.0f;
SDL_RenderCopyEx(renderer, texture, NULL, &destRect, rotationAngle , NULL, SDL_FLIP_NONE);
```
